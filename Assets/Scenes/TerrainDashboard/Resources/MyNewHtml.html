	This is the widget template for a <b>floating window</b> containing windowContent.html.
	<br><br>
	It was opened with the widget:// url scheme - if you click it again, this widget will close.
	<br><br>
	This widget resizes and moves too - Drag either the window itself or the bottom right corner.

function runGameCode(){
	// Import the C# namespace called JavascriptExample:

	// In it is a class called JsExampleClass with a static method called Hello - let's run that:
	jsExample.JavascriptInterface.Hello();

/*
Here's a simple way to pass in variables to an opening widget. Note that they can be accessed from C# too.

Calling document.widgets.open or adding a query string to the widget URL
will set global variables. They're available immediately!

------------------------
E.g. The widget URL that loads up this content is..

widget://floating/WindowExample/windowContent.html?hello=javascript

We'll get a global called 'hello' and it's value is 'javascript'.

*/

// Show it:
console.log("The widget URL set the hello global to:");
console.log(hello);
